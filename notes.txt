But i would try to work on more dynamic content like delegate arkx missing blocks
Delegate arky stopped forging
Or jarunik voted into rop 51
Chris voted out
I think thats what makes arkbot so popular
Static links should better be on a link list or so
Slack command spam for links is annoying i think
If it is just static links
why does he always posts two responses ? ^^
